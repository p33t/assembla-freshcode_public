Some more manual notes on Scala....

Look at a class after implicits have been expanded / inserted...
scalac -Xprint:typer <some file>

ADT: Algebraic Data Types
- The type is the sum / union of its data constructors
- A data constructor is the product of it arguments

'lift' a function into other uses, like a=>b can be lifted into Option[a]=>Option[b]

'strict' mean eval all args, 'non-strict' is lazy eval
