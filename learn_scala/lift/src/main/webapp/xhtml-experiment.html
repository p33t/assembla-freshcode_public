    Having played a little with page types and urls.  The following is possible:
    - Can have .xhtml file but will only render when navigating to .html OR
    - Can leave off the .html extension and the url will succeed


    Idea: use .xhtml and link without the .html extensions
    + can have strict xml for content pages
    + will indicate that the page is different to that rendered at the end
    - all urls will show up as broken in html file utilities

    Thoughts:
    It seems a fundamental goal of lift is to have .html files that will standalone
    and thus be editable by simple author tools.
    Using the idea above prevents all this.
