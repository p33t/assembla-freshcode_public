Some more notes that are can't be illustrated with code...

From 'Simply Lift' - Scaling
Lift requires session affinity.
IE: A load balancer must route a request to the same JVM that serviced the previous request on the same session.
Lift sessions are too complex to serialize.

Lift resists a number of attack vectors due to GUID/function association...the client never sees relational data IDs.
