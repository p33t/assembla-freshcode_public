Background
----------
- Contract in 2010 to start a new desktop application
-- Unfamiliar territory: typically most tech decisions are already made (hastily)
-- Spent a good deal of time sorting out the plumbing
--- Not IP, just tech meshing, coding techniques and good practices
-- Discovered that mocking frameworks use a technique that could be useful
   in production code.  Called 'MethodTriggers'.

- Created a demo app for reference purposes
-- Don't want to have to retrace steps

- Not
-- Rich Client Platform tutorial (Netbeans, Eclipse etc.)
--- Probably useful but not that much fun to learn
-- A style guide
--- Ask questions but be prepared to agree to disagree
-- Idealogical crusade
--- Dodgy practices that if used in controlled manner have high utility
--- EG. Ref<T> ... effectively pass-by-reference
-- An Introduction To Swing
--- Ask questions but be prepared for an abbreviated answer
--- Ask me later for a step in the right direction

- I enjoy hobby projects immensely but have trouble getting them off the ground
-- Hopefully anyone else that suffers from this will benefit


Packaging
---------
- Build and install new Zip file
- Open the jar and show the manifest: mainclass and classpath
