Notes from setting up Unloved Bastard keyboard controller (from bathroom epiphanies / bpiphanies / 1up keyboards). It uses an ATmel mega32u2 (ATmega32U2) chip.

- Use Windows (Linux too hard because python lib drama)
- Install Flip dependency with 'Typical' configuration. 'Custom' doesn't work.
- Keyboard needs to be in 'boot mode', which disconnects keyboard (sound will play)
  - pressing both shift keys is the default from bpiphany
  - magnet didn't work. Maybe it wasn't strong enough, maybe electronics switch is too old
  - my WinKeyAsFnKey EasyAVR configuration (attached) sets Fn+Esc as boot mode keystroke
- Install drivers for 'Unknown device' in device manager using 'Have Disk'
  - I had actually install ahead of time using Legacy driver setup option in Device Manager


More notes....

Installing 'Flip' didn't work with 'Custom' installation. 'Typical' worked fine.
  This after trying to install JDK 1.5 update 22 but flip couldn't find.

Trying to reprogram but “AtLibUsbDfu.dll not found”

  Refers to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ9BjKjGnIc
    >>> didn't help
  In Device Manager. Select "Action/Add legacy hardware" and "Select from list", "Next" x2, "Have Disk"
    Pick the file from Flip/usb folder. Then "ATmega32U2" (because that is printed on the chip)
    >>> Now Flip app can connect (does not show previous error message)


Instead of error:
Opening port........................... FAIL    ISP done.

Now I get:
Opening port........................... FAIL    Could not open USB device.
ISP done.
AtLibUsbDfu: 3EB 2FF0 no device present.

So this is progress. I think boot mode is not engaged

Magnet didn't seem to be working. Maybe it's not strong enough or switch is old (?!).
Article from Samual Bernou said pressing both shift keys is the default from bpiphany. THIS WORKED!
Then I was able to succeed in flashing the keyboard firmware with EasyAVR (output below).
From my key layout, the 'boot mode' is in layer 2 'Esc'. Layer 2 activated with "FN" key.
It looks like a couple key caps were switched so will swap those back. (rt windows & rt Alt)
