Additional notes about ExtJS...

Deployment (from Getting Started | 3. Deployment)
----------
- Production deployment should use a custom built ExtJS (to shed unecessary classes)
- SDK tool will perform this build AND create a minimised version of app.js

Classes (from Class System)
-------
- v4 introduced a new way to define and instantiate classes for convenience and to facilitate dynamic loading
-- Ext.define() and Ext.create() which require string class names
- Ext.Class pre-processor provides support for rich, validated class configuration
-- config field
-- applyXxx() validation before setter
-- configs can be nested and peeled open by relevant applyXxx() function
- Static elements (common to all instances)
-- statics field where 'this' has a different meaning (it is the class itself... used for new-ing)
